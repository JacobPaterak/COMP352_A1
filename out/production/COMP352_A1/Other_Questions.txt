b,)


c,) No it is not a tail Recursive algorithm because the call to the function is not the last thing to happen
    ii,)The tail recursive algorithm cannot be made because you have to call the method multiple times and add
        them for you to get the right answer example Oddonnacci(4) = Oddonnacci(3) + Oddonnacci(2) + Oddonnacci(1)
